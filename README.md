# Address-Book

Tools Used:
For this test I used various online resources to build my code. I was unfamiliar with some elements of ReactJS and had to research a number of things as I was moving forward. As a result, most of my code is built from researching tools and examples online. Once I used <code>npx create-react-app address-book</code>, I navigated to the address book using <code>cd address-book</code> and then used <code>npm start</code> to start the development server. From there, I was able to view my work from
<code>localhost:3000</code> in-browser as I worked. 

Basic Summary: The application works as follows; 
<br>
1. Fill in the applicants first name, last name, email, and phone number. The form will not accept an email without an <code>@</code> sign and a <code>.</code> sign. 
2. The phone number must be 9 digits across without spaces. 
3. Once entered and the button "Add" is pushed the entry appears below the input form.
4. From here, the data can either be deleted or edited. Unfortunately, the edit button simply deletes the data instead of editing it as I was unable to figure out how to edit the data after submission.

This was as far as I was able to get with the test given and with my current skillset. To run this application, follow the method I used in "Tools Used" to achieve the same results.
